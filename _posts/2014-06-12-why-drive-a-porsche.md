title: Why I drive a Porsche?
---

There are few things in life that reflect with your personality and connect with your inner self.
A Porsche is one of them. I have driven many cars across various segments, but nothing
connected with me like my Boxster. It is waiting for my orders to accelerate like a wild horse
or negotiate the tight curves of Big Sur with high precision. This is the only car that responds at
the speed of my thought. Even if I am not constantly driving at high speeds, the occasional thrill
of shifting to the 4th gear to hunt down a speeding BMW cannot be paralleled. This car makes me
feel like a powerful king who can win over any obstacle in my way.
