title: Reclaiming my life
---

I have had serious psychological issues during the last 10 months. I have spent every waking moment trying to find a solution, but ended up getting deeper into the problem. I started practicing Isha Yoga from April. It made me understand the problem better but brought no solution to sight. Today, my issues became so big that I started thinking about exit strategies from life :( This is it. This is the end. I am putting an end to all this drama and going to lead a normal life like my dad and mom. Here are my problems and my plans to solve them:

1. _I am not able to find happiness even after searching for 10 months_
  
  Solution: Happiness is not in the outside world, happiness is NOT inside my body/mind. It is NOT in the past and NOT in the future. It is in the present moment. It is in the things in front of me. It is in the things that I already have. It is from the people that I already know and through activities that I already do. **Mundane == Happiness**!!

2. _I want to achieve something big_

  > I want to travel to space, I want to drive a race car, I want to build a company like Steve Jobs, 
  > I want to fame, I want money, I want to dress fancy, I want to be an extrovert, 
  > I want to be called a genius by others, I want to be Einstein, I want to be famous

  Solution: Why do you want to all the above? A few months ago, getting a job in a startup was in the list. After getting it were you any more happier? Go read the Solution #1. 

3. _I want to work like crazy, create something big and be famous_

  Solution: Read solution #2. 

4. _I want to live my life like Gandhi_

  Solution: Who will live your life if you live Gandhi's life? Go read solution #2.

5. _I am afraid to make the right decisions_

  Solution: What are you afraid about? Is it the decision or the effect of the decision? As long as your decision doesn't kill you or do anything unlawful, take the decision with courage. 

6. _Will my life be useless if I stop desiring for everything?_

   Solution: Are you happy despite wanting so many things? Hell No. You won't be any worse if you stop desiring. Instead read solution #1 and stay happy and contended.


### Steps to refocus my life:

(This is my fourth grand attempt to refocus my life in the last 10months. I feel ashamed that I am making a huge mess of life. It is ok. I will keep trying and hoping that this is the last one)

#### Pre-conditions:

1. I can't stop using internet.
2. I can't become an OCD
3. I can't code all day
4. I can't keep my desk clean; I can't always do my laundry

#### Actions:

1. I will be grateful to all the gifts I have in life today
2. There is only one thing that can give me happiness - It is the moment **NOW**. Be cognizant of it.
3. Don't advice anyone about their life. Every one knows better than you!
4. Donate $1 to someone everyday, in person. 
5. Remove focus from internet. Instead of randomly browsing the internet (HN, FB, Twitter, email etc), do the following:
  1. Read a book 
  2. Do household chores
  3. Talk to people physically around you with complete involvement
  4. Learn cooking
  5. Wash and clean my car
  6. Run
  6. Plan for vacations, or other imminent events
  7. Do laundry
  8. Write a prose/poetry
  9. Teach someone
6. Be true to your heart. Openly and bluntly communicate everything to everyone. Be very transparent.
7. Take sad moments lightly. They are ephemeral. They won't harm you.
8. Be very very happy. Bubbling with happiness and contentment :)
9. Go _love_ someone
