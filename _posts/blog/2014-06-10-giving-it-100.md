title: Giving it 100 - 100 days of coding and blogging

Recently, I learnt about this website called [Give It 100](https://giveit100.com/).
It is a fun way to learn something new by posting a short video of your practice every day to their website,
for the next 100 days. I think this is a very effective method of keeping up your commitment
and at the same time visually monitor your progress over time. 


I am doing to try and apply this concept to learn a new web development framework 
and improve my writing. Every day for the next 100 days, I will spend 45mins to work on a website
and 15mins to blog about my experiences of the day before. 


In my day job as a programmer, I spend easily an average of 8hrs per day coding or, at the least,
sitting in front of the computer. I think spending this one hour should not be very tough.
