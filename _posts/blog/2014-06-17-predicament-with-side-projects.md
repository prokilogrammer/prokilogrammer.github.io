As a part of the #GiveIt100 challenge, I am working on a side project called Tasterhood (more about it coming soon). 
Even though this project is super-fun, it requires considerable mental attention which is scares after many hours of coding at work. 
In addition to that, I get the predicament of whether I should spend my time doing Tasterhood or continue doing office work.
Because I am working at a startup, my work is just as exciting as Tasterhood and deciding between the two is always a tough choice.
Whenever there is a tie, I chose the one that pays the bills :-)
