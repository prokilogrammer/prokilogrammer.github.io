Today I'm going to attend my first networking event - Startup Grind. Here are some of my objectives for this event:

1. Learn how to know what to build? - I have an idea, and I think implementing it one way might be useful. But since this is a B2B company, and since I don't have experience with target domain, how to    find out what exactly my future customers will want?

 Methods to answer:
  - Talk to people who built/are building B2B companies. Probe them about their baby steps
  - If someone is having few extra mins, try to pitch my idea and see what they have to offer

2. Make connections: Need to find people who build B2B companies (OR) work in customer service space

 Methods:
   - Get their full name and connect with them on LinkedIn immediately thru phone. 
   - If they have, get their business card and send them a request later
   - Send follow up emails to all my aquiantiances.
   - Schedule lunch/coffee meetings with people who respond
   - [Plan B] Even if people are not in B2B space, but seem pretty influential, connect with them.

3. Learn how to network: For starters, it is enough to make 2-3 connections.
