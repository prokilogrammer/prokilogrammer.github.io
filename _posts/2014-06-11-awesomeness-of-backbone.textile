I am working on making a simple website with Django for the backend and Backbone.js for frontend. 
While Django has already impressed me, Backbone.js blew my mind. Ever since my the last website I wrote 
5 yrs back, this landscape has changed pretty dramatically. With Backbone.js + REST, I no longer have to
worry about names for the endpoints, encoding for request and response, returning HTML in response, or 
even AJAX. I feel like I almost travelled through time to the future. Did Nostradamus already predict this?
