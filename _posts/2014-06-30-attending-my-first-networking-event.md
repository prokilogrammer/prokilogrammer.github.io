title: Attending my first networking event - Startup Grind
---

Today I'm going to attend my first networking event - Startup Grind. Here are some of my objectives for this event:
1. Learn how to know what to build? - I have an idea, and I think implementing it one way might be useful. But since this is a B2B company, and since I don't have experience with target domain, how to find out what exactly my future customers will want?

  Methods to answer:
    a. Talk to people who built/are building B2B companies. Probe them about their baby steps
    b. If someone is having few extra mins, try to pitch my idea and see what they have to offer

2. Make connections: Need to find people who build B2B companies (OR) work in customer service space

  Methods:
    a. Get their full name and connect with them on LinkedIn immediately thru phone. 
    b. If they have, get their business card and send them a request later
    c. Send follow up emails to all my aquiantiances. 
    d. Schedule lunch/coffee meetings with people who respond
    e. [Plan B] Even if people are not in B2B space, but seem pretty influential, connect with them.

3. Learn how to network: For starters, it is enough to make 2-3 connections.
