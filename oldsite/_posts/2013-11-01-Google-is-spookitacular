title: Google is spookitacular
---

My friend is flying from Los Angeles airport tonight to meet me. Since I heard about a shotting incident in LAX this morning, I Googled for "LAX flight status". Holy cow, Google displayed detailed information about the flight my friend was going to take! My initial reaction was fear; fear that Google knew about my plans just through my searches. But it turns out that since I was signed-in, Google read through my emails and pulled up this information from the flight itenerary that my forwarded to me. Now that is spectacular! Still spooky indeed.
